APOE-C130R,APOE,"This is generally known as the ApoE4 allele of ApoE and is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's. 20-25% of individuals are heterozygous for this variant, and 1-2% are homozygous.

Notably, their model suggests 70-75% of people would eventually develop Alzheimer's by the age of 100 regardless of ApoE4 genotype (and 25-30% are resistant, regardless of genotype), but that ApoE4 variants shift the disease onset to occur significantly earlier (4 years earlier for heterozygous carriers, 13 years for homozygotes).",High,Well-established,Pathogenic,0.14,Mental and behavioral;Nervous system,Complex/Other,Heterozygous,9343467;11950276;15123497;17428983,rs429358,4,chr19,45411941,C,http://evidence.personalgenomes.org/genomes?display_genome_id=121b3603cad6230d1a89738c48606798dd7c4aaf&access_token=8fcd50e86b060b5c84cd7df09da9f45d

GALT-N314D,GALT,"This variant has an allele frequency of ~8% and is ancestral to ""Duarte"" / ""Duarte 2"" and ""Duarte 1""/""Los Angeles"" galactosemia variants. This variant is evolutionarily ancestral, and in vitro studies fail to support an impact of this variant on enzyme activity. Carney et al. instead implicate a 4 base deletion on the 5' of the GALT gene as being causal and linked to this variant.
